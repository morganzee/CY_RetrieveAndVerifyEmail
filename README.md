# CY_RetrieveAndVerifyEmail
#Generating a Random Email:

The code starts by visiting a web page (presumably a signup page) and generates a random email address using a combination of a timestamp (randomString based on the current time) and a predefined email domain.

#Filling the Signup Form:
It interacts with the signup form by clicking on a signup link, typing a first name ("Morgan"), last name ("Musa"), and the generated email address into the corresponding input fields. Finally, it clicks the submit button.

#Retrieving and Verifying Email:
The code then uses Mailosaur (a tool for testing email functionality) to retrieve the email sent to the generated address.
Once the email is retrieved, the test verifies that the email subject is "Welcome to ACME Product," indicating a successful signup.
It extracts the confirmation/signup link from the email's HTML content.

Finally, it visits the extracted link using Cypress to simulate the user clicking on the confirmation link.
In summary, the test ensures that the signup process on the website works correctly by filling out the form and confirming the email. It uses Mailosaur to simulate the email verification step without relying on a real email service. This type of test is commonly used for end-to-end testing of user registration and email verification workflows in web applications.
